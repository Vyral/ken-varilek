Today I’m answering a question that I hear constantly from my clients, “How much money do I need to buy a house?” To break it down for you, I’ll use an example of a $200,000 house with approximately $4,500 in taxes for our example today.&nbsp;

**The biggest cost associated with purchasing a house is the down payment, which can be anywhere from nothing up until 20%.** You’ll also have to budget in title insurance, which would cost around $1,500 for this kind of home. This ensures that you get a clean deed.

A transfer tax of 2% is generally split between the buyer and the seller. **Property taxes are typically held in escrow, but you’ll have to pay for one year upfront most likely.** Homeowners insurance will set you back another $850 and home inspections can run you around at least $600. “Lender fees” typically add up to another $1,200. Finally, property appraisals are always around $450 a month. &nbsp;

**So with a standard FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment, this $200,000 is going to cost you around $18,000 out of pocket.** There are ways that we can shrink those costs, but that’s a story for another day.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about what it will take for you to buy a house or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
