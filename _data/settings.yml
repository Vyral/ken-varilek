  about_markdown: |
    Hello, my name is Ken Varilek. My passion is to help buyers close the deal on their dream home. I am honored to help them get the best price, avoid the pitfalls, and close knowing that no stone was unturned and the purchase is a solid one. I have been a resident of the Lehigh Valley and a trusted business professional for over 25 years. As a Father of three, I understand the needs of a growing family. A house gives you shelter, but a home is where you hang jackets, build snowmen, and lay in the grass watching the clouds go by. It's that feeling you get when you walk through the door and get attacked with love by your furry best friend. I am proud to work, fish, hunt, and play here in Lehigh Valley. I am a member of Lehigh Valley Business Group, Lehigh Valley Association of Realtors, National Association of Realtors, Delaware River Smallmouth Group, Eastern PA Fishing Reports, and a Sponsoring Member. I love to make connections! Please feel free to give me a call and share your needs, wants, and dreams. I would be happy to provide you with a free consultation and a market analysis including the surrounding area and the value of your home.
